Kindly note that I currently have not worked on any projects
that are public on gitHub. This year my main focus was dedicated 
towards completing my degree and therefore I could not allocate time 
for side projects. I will however be starting some projects this holiday
that have captured my curiosity on towardsdatascience.com, thecleverprogrammer.com
and of course hyperionDev.com.
